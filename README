Multi-Module Maven GWT JRebel Example Project

OVERVIEW
	This project exists to demonstrate a bug in JRebel when using GWT where changes to client-side classes in a maven-module are not detected by JRebel, but changes in the local project are. The project is intended to be as simple as possible while still demonstrating the bug.
	
USE
	To reproduce the issue, follow these steps:
	
	1. Compile the project:
		mvn install -Djrebel.jar.path=/path/to/jrebel.jar
	2. Run the GWT App with JRebel:
		cd GwtApp
		mvn gwt:run -Djrebel.jar.path=/path/to/jrebel.jar
	3. Open the app in your web browser with the GWT plugin by clicking the appropriate button in the GWT Developer app
	4. At this point, it can be seen that JRebel is monitoring both the local and the library classes directory, and that it has instrumented local classes, but not the library classes:
		./check-rebel-log.sh # From the GwtApp directory
	5. To demonstrate the issue, change the LibraryLabel class to update the text it prints to the screen, and then mvn:compile the changes:
		GwtLibrary/src/main/java/org/hypher/mavengwt/library/client/LibraryLabel.java
	6. Note that the change does not show up in the client. To show that JRebel is working for local classes, modify the LocalLabel class, and then mvn:compile the changes:
		GwtApp/src/main/java/org/hypher/mavengwt/client/LocalLabel.java
	7. The tracing-enabled jrebel log file is available in GwtApp/rebel.log
	8. An example rebel log of the issue can be found in GwtApp/rebel.log.example
